# To-Do Application

## JavaScript MasterClass Project No.2

This application was built following JavaScript MasterClass [course](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/javascript-masterclass/9781837637904/9781837637904-video10_1/). The aim of the project was to learn more about accessing elements in the DOM, data from a form and event listeners.

User is able to add, remove and filter tasks. Currently the project doesn't store input, so all tasks will be lost after refreshing the page.
